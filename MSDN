This is our implementation of Multi-level Scene Description Network in Scene Graph Generation from Objects, Phrases and Region Captions. The project is based on PyTorch version of faster R-CNN. (Update: model links have been updated. Sorry for the inconvenience.)

We have released our newly proposed scene graph generation model in our ECCV-2018 paper:

Factorizable Net: An Efficient Subgraph-based Framework for Scene Graph Generation.
